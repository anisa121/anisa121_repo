# TODO List for UI/UX Redesign

- [x] Change header h1 in index.html from "OUR FUTURE - OUR KIDS" to "Educational Team"
- [x] Update styles.css to use softer green, white, and yellow tones for a more pleasurable design
- [x] Enhance design elements: increase border-radius, add soft shadows, subtle animations, warmer yellows in backgrounds
- [x] Verify page loads correctly and colors appear pleasurable (server running on port 8000)
- [x] Test responsiveness on different screen sizes (CSS media queries in place for mobile/tablet)
