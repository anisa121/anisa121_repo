# Language Implementation Plan

- [x] Translate index.html to French as default (change lang="en" to "fr", translate all content)
- [x] Add language switching logic to script.js (translations object, toggle function, localStorage persistence)
- [x] Ensure mobile compatibility in styles.css (touch-friendly button)
- [ ] Test functionality on mobile
